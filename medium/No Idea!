There is an array of integers. There are also disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m integers. 
You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. 
For each integer i in the array, if i in A you add 1 to your happiness. If i in B, you add -1
to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.
Input Format
The first line contains n and m integers separated by a space.
The second line contains n integers, the elements of the array.
The third and fourth lines contain m integers, A and B, respectively.
Output Format
Output a single integer, your total happiness.

n, m = map(int, input().split())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
set_a = set(map(int, input().split()))
set_b = set(map(int, input().split()))

res = 0
for elem in arr:
    if elem in set_a:
        res += 1
    elif elem in set_b:
        res -= 1
print(res)
