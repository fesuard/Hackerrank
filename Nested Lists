Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N

students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    records = {}
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        if score not in records:
            records[score] = [name]
        else:
            records[score].append(name)
    sorted_keys = sorted(records.keys())
    second_lowest_key = sorted_keys[1]
    second_lowest_values = records[second_lowest_key]
    second_lowest_values.sort()
    for name in second_lowest_values:
        print(name)
