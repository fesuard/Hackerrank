Marie invented a Time Machine and wants to test it by time-traveling to visit Russia on the 
Day of the Programmer (the 256th day of the year) during a year in the inclusive range from 1700 to 2700. 
Given a year y, find the date of the 256th day of that year according to the official Russian calendar during that year.
Then print it in the format dd.mm.yyyy, where dd is the two-digit day, mm is the two-digit month, and yyyy is y.

def dayOfProgrammer(year):
    if year >= 1700 and year <= 1917:
        if year % 4 == 0:
            return f'12.09.{year}'
        else:
            return f'13.09.{year}'
    elif year == 1918:
        return f'26.09.1918'
    else:
        if year % 400 == 0 or ((year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0)):
            return f'12.09.{year}'
        else:
            return f'13.09.{year}'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    year = int(input().strip())

    result = dayOfProgrammer(year)

    fptr.write(result + '\n')

    fptr.close()
