Given a year, determine whether it is a leap year. If it is a leap year, return the Boolean True, otherwise return False.

Note that the code stub provided reads from STDIN and passes arguments to the is_leap function. It is only necessary to complete the is_leap function.
The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

def is_leap(year):
    leap = False
    if year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0:
        leap = True

    if year % 4 == 0 and year % 400 == 0:
        leap = True
  
    return leap
